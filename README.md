## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can solve real business challenges in logistics and product authentication, creating an immutable record of a product's journey through the supply chain.

### Blockchain Architecture & Implementation

- Built on Ethereum with Solidity smart contracts for immutable record-keeping
- Implemented ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent unique product identities
- Created role-based access control for manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers
- Designed gas-efficient smart contracts to minimize transaction costs
- Integrated real-time event logging using blockchain emitted events

### Technical Components

- **Smart Contract System:** Multi-layered contract architecture with upgradeable proxy pattern
- **Authentication Mechanism:** Zero-knowledge proof implementation for privacy-preserving verification
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive supply chain map showing product journey in real-time
- **IoT Integration:** Framework for connecting with temperature sensors and RFID readers
- **Alert System:** Automated notification system for supply chain exceptions

### Analytics & Insights

- **Real-time Dashboards:** Visualization of product journey times, delays, and exceptions
- **Predictive Models:** Machine learning algorithms to predict potential delays based on historical blockchain data
- **Anomaly Detection:** Statistical models to identify unusual patterns in supply chain data
